Things to consider for more serious implementation:

1. User sign up/sign in and scoping shortenings to users
2. Copy to clipboard button next to shortened URL to improve UX
3. Serious URL format regex validation
4. Better algorithm to generate slugs (see notes in lib/shortener/slugs.ex)
5. Service abuse protection by rate limiting client requests
6. Validate that the URL actually points to a valid resource
7. Expiration of shortenings and potential recycling of slugs?
